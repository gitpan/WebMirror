This is Fefe's WebMirror program.
It can recursively mirror remote WWW sites to a local directory,
adjusting links while doing so so you can browse the files
locally.
WebMirror can be ordered to follow outbound links 1 level deep
without saving them, so it can be used to verify the correctness
of links in a hierarchy, too.
